(h). (2 points) \textsl{Are there other actors that play an important role but are not on the list of investigation (i.e., actors who are not among the 23 listed above) ? List them, and explain why they are important. ($\sim$50 words, 100 word limit.)}\\

\textbf{Solution}:\\
There are 9 actors who are not listed among the 23 above, but have a high mean betweenness centrality over all phases. These actors are in the top 23 according to this centrality criterion, but not in the list of investigation: [13, 31, 22, 9, 7, 37, 79, 14, 41].\\

They are likely to be important for the network according to their mean centrality over all phases of this investigation.\\
